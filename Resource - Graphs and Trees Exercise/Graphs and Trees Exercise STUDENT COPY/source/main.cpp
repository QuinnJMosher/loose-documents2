  AUTHOR:	Joshua Carter.
  WARNING:	Hacky uncommented code inside.

  README:	-	You may look at any of the source code in this project 
				but it should be mostly unnecessary. 
			-	You only really need to	know that the Node class has an 
				x/y position and a vector of Node pointers (no edge 
				class is needed for this example).
			-	The FindPath function is called for you when a new graph
				is generated (by pressing the SPACE key).
			-	You will probably want to create another function to do
				the recursive walking of the graph and return the path
				it took from start to end.
			-	There are a few vector2 style operations in the Math.h
				file that you can use.
			-	Due to the framework used, link-lines cannot be drawn
				behind the nodes ._.
